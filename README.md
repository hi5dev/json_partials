# JSON Partials

Easily create large JSON documents from smaller partials written in Ruby.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'json_partials'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install json_partials

## Usage



## Development

This project is configured to use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for development. It is set up for
[Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/), which uses [Almquist Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell)
instead of Bash, so if you need to open a shell run `docker-compose run ruby ash`.
